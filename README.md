# Data-Science-Portfolio
My date science portfolio is divided into three main sections. The first section covers data analysis which highlights descriptive and inferential statistics as well as my data visualization skills. The next part features my data science case studies which focus on evaluating and solving complex issues with machine learning answers. Finally, the last part of my portfolio focuses on programs I have relation to data science and feature my wider programming skills.

## Case Study: Synthetic Endangered Species Observation Analysis
Through the utilization of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the application of the Chi-Squared test of independence, this study delves into an extensive dataset comprising observations of endangered species with the primary objective of investigating potential interdependencies among them. EDA, a fundamental approach in statistical data analysis, allows for the systematic exploration and visualization of various data characteristics, facilitating the identification of patterns, trends, and outliers within the dataset. Employing this analytical technique enables us to gain valuable insights into the complex interactions between endangered species and discern potential relationships that may exist among them.

Furthermore, the Chi-Squared test of independence, a powerful statistical tool, is harnessed to rigorously assess the degree of association between categorical variables in the dataset. This inferential test enables us to evaluate the null hypothesis, which posits that the observed relationships between endangered species are purely due to chance. By quantifying the strength of the associations and determining the statistical significance of the observed dependencies, we can establish whether the presence of one endangered species significantly influences the occurrence or behavior of others within the ecosystem.

Through this comprehensive analytical approach, the research aims to unravel underlying connections and potential causal relationships among endangered species, providing valuable insights into the intricate dynamics within their habitat. The results obtained from this investigation hold significant implications for conservation efforts, as understanding the interconnectedness of endangered species could inform targeted conservation strategies and resource allocation to safeguard these vulnerable populations. Moreover, this study contributes to the broader field of environmental research, offering a methodological framework that can be adapted and applied to diverse ecological datasets, promoting a deeper understanding of the intricate web of relationships between species and their environments. As the global community continues to grapple with pressing issues of biodiversity loss and habitat degradation, the findings of this study may pave the way for evidence-based conservation policies that foster the preservation of endangered species and the delicate ecological balance they inhabit.
