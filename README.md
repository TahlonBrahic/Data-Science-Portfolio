# Data-Science-Portfolio
My date science portfolio is divided into three main sections. The first section covers data analysis which highlights descriptive and inferential statistics as well as my data visualization skills. The next part features my data science case studies which focus on evaluating and solving complex issues with machine learning answers. Finally, the last part of my portfolio focuses on programs I have relation to data science and feature my wider programming skills.
